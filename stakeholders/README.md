# Stakeholder Views

**Your role. Your risks. Your entry point into the framework.**

> *Part of the [AI Runtime Behaviour Security](../)*

---

This framework covers a lot of ground — risk tiers, three-layer controls, PACE resilience, MASO multi-agent security, infrastructure controls, regulatory mappings, strategy. Nobody needs all of it.

These pages tell you **what matters for your role**, **why you should care**, and **where to start reading**. Each one is a window into the framework from your perspective — not a summary of everything, but a filter for what's relevant to your work.

## Pick Your Role

| Role | Who It's For | Core Question |
|---|---|---|
| **[Security Leaders](security-leaders.md)** | CISOs, Security Directors, Security Architects | *How do I secure AI when the threat model is unlike anything I've secured before?* |
| **[Risk & Governance](risk-and-governance.md)** | CROs, Risk Managers, GRC Teams | *How do I quantify AI risk and prove to the board that controls are working?* |
| **[Enterprise Architects](enterprise-architects.md)** | Solution Architects, Platform Architects, Technical Leads | *Where do controls go in my pipeline, what do they cost, and how do they fail?* |
| **[Product Owners](product-owners.md)** | Product Managers, Business Owners, Delivery Leads | *What controls are required to ship AI, and what do they cost in time and money?* |
| **[AI Engineers](ai-engineers.md)** | ML Engineers, AI Developers, Data Scientists, Platform Engineers | *What do I actually build? Give me implementation patterns, not governance theory.* |
| **[Compliance & Legal](compliance-and-legal.md)** | Compliance Officers, Legal Counsel, DPOs, Audit Teams | *How do I demonstrate that AI deployments meet regulatory obligations — with evidence?* |

## How These Pages Work

Each stakeholder page follows the same structure:

1. **The problem from your perspective** — why AI security isn't like the security you already know
2. **What this framework gives you** — the specific parts relevant to your work
3. **Your starting path** — ordered reading list, 3-5 documents deep
4. **What you can do Monday morning** — concrete first actions
5. **Common objections addressed** — the pushback you'll get, with answers

These are entry points, not destinations. Follow the links into the full framework when you need depth.
