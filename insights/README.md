## Core Concepts

**[The Judge Detects. It Doesn't Decide.](judge-detects-not-decides.md)** (650 words)

Why using LLMs to block transactions is a mistake. The case for async evaluation over real-time control.

**[Infrastructure Beats Instructions](infrastructure-beats-instructions.md)** (800 words)

You can't secure AI agents with prompts. Why constraints must be enforced in infrastructure, not instructions.

**[Risk Tier Is Use Case, Not Technology](risk-tier-is-use-case.md)** (850 words)

The same model can be low-risk or critical. Classification is about deployment, not capability.

**[Humans Remain Accountable](humans-remain-accountable.md)** (900 words)

AI assists. Humans own outcomes. Why accountability can't be delegated to algorithms.

## Emerging AI Challenges

How the framework applies — or doesn't — to emerging AI capabilities.

**[Multimodal AI Breaks Your Text-Based Guardrails](multimodal-breaks-guardrails.md)** (950 words)

Images, audio, and video create attack surfaces your current controls can't see.

**[When AI Thinks Before It Answers](when-ai-thinks.md)** (900 words)

Reasoning models create a new problem: do you trust the thinking you can't see?

**[When Agents Talk to Agents](when-agents-talk-to-agents.md)** (950 words)

Multi-agent systems create accountability gaps your framework doesn't cover.

**[The Memory Problem](the-memory-problem.md)** (1,000 words)

Long context and persistent memory create attack surfaces that accumulate over time.

**[You Can't Validate What Hasn't Finished](you-cant-validate-unfinished.md)** (900 words)

Real-time AI breaks the inspect-then-deliver model.
